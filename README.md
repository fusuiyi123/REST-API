## Express REST API Server with MongoDB and Mongoose
  * The app is generated by Express-Generator.
  * The model has three schemas: dishes, promotions and leaderships.
  * They all support GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
## Example Usage
  * Make sure your mongodb is running and open postman. Go to the directory and type:
  * npm install
  * npm start
  ---
  * GET localhost:3000/dishes *return all the dishes in the database*.
  * POST localhost:3000/dishes *create dishes given the body of your request*.
  * PUT localhost:3000/dishes *not supported*.
  * DELETE localhost:3000/dishes *delete all the dishes in the database*.
  ---
  * GET localhost:3000/dishes/dishId *return all the dishes with dishId in the database*.
